First attempt at building a basic HTML website
Once completed, there should be evidence of using a variation of basic code tags, elements and attributes correctly. 
Combining links, images, lists and a dash of irony, the end result will display a functioning, though simple, website that is easy to navigate and will form the basis for further projects and practice. 
The code is expected to be tidy, concise and presented in an efficient format that is a pleasure to read and edit if required.
